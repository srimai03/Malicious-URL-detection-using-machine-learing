# Malicious-URL-detection-using-machine-learing
The project titled Malicious URL Detection using Machine Learning aims to build an intelligent system capable of automatically classifying URLs as either malicious or benign using machine learning techniques. In the current digital age, cyber threats such as phishing, malware attacks, and online frauds are frequently executed through deceptive URLs. Traditional security systems like blacklists and rule-based filters are often unable to detect newly generated or obfuscated malicious URLs, leading to significant security risks. This project addresses that limitation by leveraging machine learning algorithms that can learn from historical data and generalize well to new, unseen threats. 
             The primary focus will be on static analysis, which means only the structural characteristics and metadata of URLs will be analyzed without visiting the actual web pages, thereby avoiding exposure to potential threats during analysis. The scope of the project includes the collection of labeled datasets from reliable sources such as PhishTank, VirusTotal, or Kaggle. These datasets typically include both malicious and benign URLs, which are essential for training supervised learning models. Once the data is collected, preprocessing steps such as normalization, cleaning, and label encoding will be carried out to ensure consistency and model compatibility. Feature engineering plays a crucial role in this project; features such as URL length, number of special characters, use of IP addresses, presence of suspicious keywords, and statistical patterns will be extracted to feed into the models. 
                            A variety of machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Gradient Boosting models like XGBoost, will be implemented and evaluated. Model performance will be assessed using standard metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to ensure reliability and robustness. The project may also include the development of a simple user interface, either command-line-based or a web application using Flask or Streamlit, where users can input URLs and get real-time classification results. While the focus is on model development and evaluation, the project does not include real-time web scraping, content-based analysis, or integration with live security APIs, as these would require additional resources and raise security concerns. 

1.2	PROJECT PURPOSE he primary purpose of this project is to design and implement a machine learning-based system capable of detecting malicious URLs with high accuracy, speed, and reliability. In today’s digital environment, cybercriminals frequently use malicious URLs as a vehicle for phishing attacks, malware distribution, identity theft, and other forms of cyber fraud. These harmful URLs often mimic legitimate websites or contain deceptive structures that can trick users into revealing sensitive information or downloading harmful content. Traditional security mechanisms such as blacklists and signature-based detection struggle to keep pace with the rapid and dynamic nature of cyber threats. These methods are often reactive, relying on previously identified threats, which leaves systems vulnerable to newly created or modified URLs.
                            To address this issue, the proposed system will utilize machine learning algorithms that can learn from existing data and identify patterns that distinguish malicious URLs from benign ones. By analyzing a variety of features—such as URL length, presence of special characters, use of suspicious keywords, and the structure of the domain name—the system can make intelligent predictions about the legitimacy of a URL without needing to access the content of the corresponding website. This approach not only improves detection accuracy but also enhances system safety by avoiding exposure to harmful web content during analysis.
                            
1.3	PROJECT FEATURES   The Malicious URL Detection using Machine Learning project offers a range of features aimed at creating a smart, efficient, and secure system for identifying harmful web links. The core functionality revolves around the automatic classification of URLs into two categories: malicious and benign. This is achieved through the use of supervised machine learning algorithms trained on labeled datasets. One of the primary features of the system is its ability to extract and analyze a variety of features from the URL text itself, which makes it fast, lightweight, and safe. Instead of relying on dynamic analysis—which involves visiting and interacting with potentially dangerous websites—the project uses static analysis, which only looks at the structure, content, and metadata of the URLs.
